  <title>The WatzThis? Chair Configuator</title>

<body>
  <p>This program creates and object called chair, loops through each of the object's properties,
    and asks the user to input a value for each property. When the user has entered a value for each
    property, the writeChairReceipt function is called and prints the properties along with the values
    that the user entered.

  <script>
    var myChair = {
      "cushionMaterial" : "",
      "numberOfLegs" : "",
      "legHeight" : ""
    };

    function configureChair() {
      var userValue;
      for (var property in myChair) {
        if (myChair.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
          userValue = prompt("Enter a value for " + property);
          myChair[property] = userValue;
        }
      }
    }

    function writeChairReceipt() {
      document.write("<h2>Your chair will have the following configuration:</h2>");
      for  (var property in myChair) {
        if (myChair.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
