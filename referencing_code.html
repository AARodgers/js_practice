<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--Wrong Way to Do! because at the JS runs, the browser doesn't yet know about the div
  with the id = "myDiv"-->
  <html>
    <head>
      <script>
        document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "This div is MY div";
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id = "myDiv">This div is your div.</div>
    </body>
  </html>

<!-- Right way to do it is to:
 1. Place your JS at the bottom of your HTML file, right before </body>
  2. Put your JS code in a function. Then you can call the function by using an onload event attribute in the
starting body tag like below-->

<html>
<head>
  <script>
    function nameMyDiv () {
      document.getElementById.innerHTML = "This div is  MY div";
    }
  </script>
  <body onload = "nameMyDiv();">
    <div id = "myDIV">This div is your div</div>
  </body>
</head>
</html>
